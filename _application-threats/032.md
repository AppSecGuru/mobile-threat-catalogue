ThreatCategory:
Threat: "Impersonating a legitimate credential entry prompt in order to trick the user into entering credentials into an app controlled by an attacker."
ThreatOrigin:
    - "Android: Adrienne Porter Felt and David Wagner in \"Phishing on Mobile Devices\", Web 2.0 Security and Privacy 2011 (May 2011)"

ExploitExample:
    - "Android: One technique is to repackage or impersonate a legitimate app (e.g. an online banking app or a healthcare app) but with extra functionality to send login credentials to an attacker. The attacker could attempt to place the fake app in the Google Play Store or distribute it through some other mechanism. Another technique is for a malicious app to silently wait in the background, repeatedly invoking Android's ActivityManager.getRunningTasks() method to check the current foreground activity being displayed to the user and waiting until a targeted UI element (e.g. username/password prompt of an online banking app, healthcare app, or enterprise app) is in the foreground. Then, the malicious app places its own, identical UI in the foreground and steals credentials.\nXbot (and maybe others) circumvents a need to use ActivityManager.getRunningTasks() by sending an official-looking push notification to the user prompting them to link a credit card to Google Pay."
    - "iOS, there have been examples of malicious apps found in the iOS App Store that steal login credentials."
CVEExample:
TacticCategory: Execution
PossibleCountermeasures:
    - "Ensure Android devices are running a recent version of the operating system, as starting in Android 5.0, ActivityManager.getRunningTasks() has been modified to stop leaking information about the current foreground activity, increasing the difficulty of malicious apps being able to perform a user interface spoofing attack"
    - "Prohibit sideloading of apps and prohibit use of unauthorized app stores"
    - "Use Android Verify Apps feature to identify harmful apps"
    - "Perform application vetting to identify inclusion of exploit code or inappropriate behaviors by apps"
    - "Use application threat intelligence data about potential risks associated with apps installed on devices"
