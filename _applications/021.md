ThreatCategory:
Threat: "Downloading and executing dynamic code after installation to evade app vetting / app store review."
ThreatOrigin: "On Android, dynamic code could include native code, Dalvik code, or JavaScript code using the Android WebView JavascriptInterface capability. On iOS, techniques for introducing dynamic code include JSPatch and method swizzling, as well as the method described by Wang et al. to construct malicious logic at app runtime."
ExploitExample:
    - "J. Oberheide. (June 2010). Android Hax. Summercon 10. Available: https://jon.oberheide.org/files/summercon10-androidhax-jonoberheide.pdf"
    - "Poeplau et al. (February 2014). Execute This! Analyzing Unsafe and Malicious Dynamic\nCode Loading in Android Applications. NDSS '14."

CVEExample:
TacticCategory: Defense Evasion
PossibleCountermeasures:
    - "Prohibit sideloading of apps and prohibit use of unauthorized app stores"
    - "Use Android Verify Apps feature to identify harmful apps"
    - "Perform application vetting to identify potentially inappropriate behaviors by apps including dynamic code execution practices"
    - "Use application threat intelligence data about potential risks associated with apps installed on devices"
