# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: > # Mobile devices pose a unique set of threats to the enterprise, but typical enterprise protections fail to address the larger picture.
    In order to fully address the threats mobile devices bring, a wider view of the mobile ecosystem is necessary.
    This document contains the Mobile Threat Catalogue, which describes, identifies, and structures the threats posed to mobile information systems.
    An associated report describing this document is available at NIST's Computer Security Resource Center at http://csrc.nist.gov
