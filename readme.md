In order to fully address the inherent threats of mobile devices, a wider view of the mobile ecosystem is necessary.
This repository contains the Mobile Threat Catalogue, which describes, identifies, and structures the threats posed to mobile information systems.
The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) seeks comment on current mobile threats addressed in the Catalogue as well as ideas for additional threats to add.
Visit the [contributing.md](contributing.md) file for more information on how to provide feedback.

Readers of the catalogue may notice there are gaps-proposed threats that are not tied to an origin source or do not have countermeasures, and threats that are missing.
The NCCoE requests mobile security industry experts and researchers to help shape the catalogue by submitting edits and additions.
Feedback can be submitted through this GitHub repository. Visit the [contributing.md](contributing.md) file for directions.

The comment period closes on Friday, October 7, 2016.
