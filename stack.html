<p><b>Mobile Operating System:</b> Operating system specifically designed for a mobile device and running mobile applications.</p>

<p><b>Device Drivers:</b> Firmware running on a mobile device often used to interact with device hardware and other peripherals (e.g., camera)</p>

<p><b>Isolated Execution Environments:</b> Hardware- or Firmware-based environment built into the mobile device that may provide many capabilities such as trusted key storage, code verification, code integrity, and trusted execution for security relevant
    processes.</p>

<p><b>Boot Firmware:</b> The firmware necessary to boot the mobile OS (i.e., bootloader), and may verify additional device initialization code, device drivers used for peripherals, and portions of the mobile OS â€“ all before a user can use the device.</p>

<p><b>Baseband Subsystem:</b> The collection of hardware and firmware used to access the cellular network, and may run a real-time operating system (RTOS).</p>

<p><b>SIM Card:</b> This removable hardware token is a System on a Chip (SoC) housing the subscriber identity (i.e., International Mobile Subscriber Identity), pre-shared cryptographic keys, and configuration information needed to obtain access to cellular
    networks.</p>
